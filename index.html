  <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
  
  <p>I asked my husband to check out my dragon website. He pointed out that a couple of fields on the contact form didn't work
  and that the read more links didn't go anywhere. I fixed the form and added external website links(SpaceX) to the " read more" links.</p>

<p>I have really enjoyed this semester. I find the content interesting.I am fascinated by the idea of building websites, but I know
if that is an area I want to pursue I will have to put in more effort and practice. I started the semester out strong, but once
some of my work wasn't saved,it derailed my progress. If I could go back I would have taken care of that right away instead of 
letting it get away from me.</p>

<p>The Dragon project helped me to understand the process better. But I think I will need to build multiple websites to get the 
information to really stick. If I could go back, I would have started on the Dragon project way sooner. If I would have started sooner
I would have felt more comfortable asking questions, when I encountered a problem.</p>
  
  
  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>Progressive Enchancement is the separation of HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT.It's focus is on building the website for the content,
  not the browser.By focusing on the content and building the website in layers, the website becomes more accesible for a larger 
  range of people, because all of the browsers are able to at least display the content.</p>
  <p>Progressive enhancement is important in modern web development because it is accessibility-oriented.It takes extra effort, but it
  broadens the horizons of who has access to the content.Learn more about Progressive Enhancement <a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/progressive-enhancement/">Here</a></p>
